# Variables

## Code

Fix this code. It is supposed to print "Alice" but something is not working.

```python
name = "alice"
name.title()
print(name)
```

Write the code to set a variable named **age** to 5. Add 10 to the age variable. Print the age variable. (Replace the question marks with your code.)

```python
age = ?
?
print(?)
```
