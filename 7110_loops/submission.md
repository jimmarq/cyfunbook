for ?:
    print(fruit + " is delicious")
```

Fill in the missing code. The program should continually prompt the user for domain names and append them to the list. When the user leaves the input blank, the program should print the list and terminate the program.

domains = []
while ?:
    answer = ?
    if ?:
        ?
    else:
        ?
```
