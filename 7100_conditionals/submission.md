# Conditionals

## Code

Write a program. The program should ask the user if they want to continue. If they answer, "y" (either uppercase or lowercase), the program should print, "Continuing." Otherwise, the program should print, "Exiting."

```python
answer = ?
if ?
    print("Continuing")
?
    print("Exiting")
```
