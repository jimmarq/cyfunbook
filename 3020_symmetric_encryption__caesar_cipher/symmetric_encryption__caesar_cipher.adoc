= Symmetric Encryption: Caesar Cipher

Changelog

* 2022-05-18 Rough Draft - inprogress - needs pics

A Caesar Cipher (also known as a subsitution cipher) is the earlist form of cyptogrophy where letters or numbers each have their own subsitute. For example if I made my own code I might look like this.

.. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz = alphabet
.. pziuytrewqasdfghjklmnbvcxo = cipher

Each letter in the alphabet has a coresponding letter in the cipher. This can also be done with numbers

Include images like so:

== Learning Objectives

You should be able to:

* History
* Pros
* Cons

The learning objectives should be measurable.

== Caesar Ciphers


Where did the name Caesar Cipher come from?

** It dates back to the Roman empire. Julius Caesar would use subsitution to encrypt his messages during war times.

Problems?

** Caesar Ciphers are very easy to crack

* Brute force, frequency analysis, and pattern recognition software are all tool that can be used to break this kind of encryption

Why use it?

** If you want to mess with your friends or family, here you go

** If you want to secure important or sensative data then don't use a Caesar Cipher. There are a host of other highly preforing encryption standards that will serve your needs far better
//This should be a couple of pages of text and screenshots.

//All images should be original. Do not include images downloaded from the internet.

//Use Greenshot to take screenshots.

//If you need to make diagrams, use draw.io.

== Exercise

Include detailed steps to practice the topic introduced in the lesson.

Use screenshots and numbered lists heavily.

Decimals are used for numbered lists.

== Reflection

* Ask a question here that makes people think.
* Ask another good question
