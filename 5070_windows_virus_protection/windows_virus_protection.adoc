You should be able to:

* Describe why virus and threat protection is important
* View your current virus and threat protection settings
* Run a custom scan

== Virus and Threat Protection

Computer viruses have been around for decades, and new viruses are created daily. Many viruses have *signatures*--patterns of code that anti-virus applications can detect. Other viruses modify their code so that each time the virus replicates it has a new signature. Anti-virus can try to detect these viruses through other means, such as finding patterns in the way that these viruses access data on the hard drive. Older generations of anti-virus software were sometimes as bad for computers as viruses themselves because they used so much of the computer's resources. Computers were sometimes slow and unusable because the anti-virus spent so much time scanning for viruses. In a sense, the anti-viruses worked just like a virus. Microsoft eventually built anti-virus into Windows so that consumers did not need to install third-party anti-virus (from companies like McAfee or Kaspersky). And Microsoft's anti-virus was good. It worked well without bringing your computer to a crawl. Still, some organizations choose to install third-party anti-virus because the third-party products provide features like centralized monitoring and reporting that they prefer over Microsoft's products.

Some people run computers without anti-virus intentionally. Every anti-virus application will impose some performance penalty on your computer. If you browse safe websites and are judicious in what applications you install, you *might* be okay running a computer without anti-virus. But sometimes malware can make it onto your machine without you doing anything wrong. A type of malware called *worms* can propagate over networks without the user doing anything. Because of the large number of known and unknown threats, it is better to run anti-virus. Occasionally, cybersecurity professionals have to test viruses, so in those cases, anti-virus can be disabled temporarily. If you are designing a network for a client, you must make anti-virus part of the design.

The image shows that a quick scan was done overnight. Only 66,900 files were scanned. There are hundreds of thousands of files on my computer. 

Include detailed steps to practice the topic introduced in the lesson.

Use screenshots and numbered lists heavily.

Decimals are used for numbered lists.
