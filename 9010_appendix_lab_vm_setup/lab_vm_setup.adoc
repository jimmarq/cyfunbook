= Lab Virtual Machine Setup

This chapter describes the Linux virtual machine used for all of the Linux labs, python, and several other labs.

Kali Linux 2022.2 was used. No additional packages were installed. No updates were installed. Updates could cause certain labs to behave differently. The guiding decision for making a simple lab environment was ease of creating and destroying the environment if needed.

When needed, files are downloaded from a GitHub repository.
