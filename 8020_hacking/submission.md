## Reflection

Consider the following scenario. You are a patron of your local public library. Something felt off about the library's website and you decide to investigate. You found that you could access other patron's records by manipulating a form. You did not have permission to perform security testing. But, your responsible disclosure could prevent a data breach. Would you report it? If so, how?
