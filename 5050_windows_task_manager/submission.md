# Windows Task Manager

## Screenshots

Include a screenshot of your task manager showing all processes. (The screenshot does not need to show every process).

## Reflection

While exploring the tabs of the Task Manager, are there any applications or settings that are surprising?

Evaluate the **Startup** tab. Are there any applications or services that you would disable?
