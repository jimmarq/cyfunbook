# Password Managers

## Screenshots

Include a screenshot of Bitwarden running in your browser unlocked (meaning you logged in).

If you use another password manager, include a screenshot of it working in your browser.

Alternatively, if you are a "conscientious objector" to password managers, briefly explain why you hate security and do not want to use one. (This is a sarcastic prompt...sort of.)
