# Editing Files With Vim

## Screenshots

Include a screenshot of you editing a file in **vim**. Include your name in the text file.

Include a screenshot that shows the command you enter the moment before you press **enter** to quit vim.

## Reflection

How much time do you anticipate spending working with text files? Is it worth investing hours to master a text editor?
