= Symmetric Encryption

* 2022-05-18 Rough Draft - needs pic's

Encyption (or Cyptogrophy) is the process of taking plain text data and scrammbling it using a cipher. Symmetric Encryption is any encryption process that uses the same key for encrypting and decrypting data.

Include images like so:

== Learning Objectives

You should be able to:

* The first Semmetric Encryption Algorithm 
* Types of Symmetric Encryption
* AES

The learning objectives should be measurable.

== Symmetric Encryption

The origional symmetric-key algorithum was a block cipher called Data Encryption Standard or DES

** Used a 64-bit block size and a 56-bit key size
** Derivatives of DES were devolped to improve it
** examples: 3DES, IDEA and Blowfish
. Block size = how many bits of data (1's and 0's) the algorith outputs after its encypted
. Key size = how many bits long the key is that the algorithum generates to decrypt the data
. The longer the Block/Key size is the harder it is to crack the encryption 

There are two major types of Symmetric-Key encryption 

. Block ciphers
** encrypt data in chunks (a certain number of byes at a time)
. Stream ciphers 
** encrypt data a single bit at a time
** much faster than block ciphers
** Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4) was the most polular for a long time until it was replaced in 2013 by AES 

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

** AES is a block cyper that uses a 128 bit block size and a 128,192 or 256 bit key
** For the time being AES is virtually uncrackable
** AES is so fast that applications that traditionally used stream ciphers have  switched to AES

== Exercise


. Go to CyberChef.org.
.. in the search bar in the top left search for AES 
. Select AES encrypt
.. drag it to right and drop it in the area labed recipes 
.. type "Isn't encrytion neat" into the input box
. Create a Key (Leave in Hex)
.. Type random letters (a-f) and numbers(1-9) until you have met either the 128, 192 or 256 requirements displayed in the output box
.. Example (I used a 256 bit Key): 100292929239239876457638742736234692348234987283426287364237628
. Create a IV (Leave in Hex)
.. Type random letters (a-f) and numbers(1-9) until you have met either the 128, 192 or 256 requirements displayed in the output box
.. Example (I used a 256 bit Key)  :3872273628736287362837642388hfhff
. OutPut
.. Now our message "Isn't encrytion neat" is enrypted with the AES algorithm
.. Copy and paste your KEY, IV and Output into a text file
. Search for AES decrypt 
.. Delete AES encrypt
.. Drag and drop AES decrypt into the recipe box
. Decrypt the data
.. Paste your output from AES encryp into the input box for AES decrypt
.. Paste your Key and IV into the AES decrypt algorithum 
. Output #2
.. You should now be looking at the same phase you entered before "Isnâ€™t encrytion neat" but now in the output section 

//. This is step two

//.This text will go under the image.

== Reflection

* What other implications can you think of where AES might be used (*hint it's not just limited to TCP/IP uses)
* How long do you think it would take to brute force the AES algorithm
