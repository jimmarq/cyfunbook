# Working with Archives

## Reflection

Write the commands to download and extract Moodle from https://download.moodle.org/releases/latest/.

Run these commands in Kali to make sure that they work.

Note that the download link will redirect you to the actual download link. If tar is unable to extract the archive, use the file command to check that you downloaded an archive.
