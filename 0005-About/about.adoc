= About this Book

This book is intended to introduce core cybersecurity topics using a hands-on approach.

This course relies heavily on virtual machines for labs. This will often require VirtualBox--a free program that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers. VirtualBox does not run on Chromebooks.
