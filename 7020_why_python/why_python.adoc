= Why Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It is expressive, meaning that a lot of work can be done in a few lines of code. Python is versatile. It can be used to create websites, artificial intelligence models, games, and more. Python is one of the top languages used by cybersecurity professionals.

== Learning Objectives

You should be able to:

* Describe the python design philosophy
* List some notable python projects

== Python's Evolution

Python first appeared in 1991. It was created by Guido van Rossum who continued to lead the python project for decades. Some of python's goals are listed in PEP 20 - The Zen of Python (https://github.com/python/peps/blob/main/pep-0020.txt).

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Readability counts.
* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Python is free for anybody to download and use. Many developers build *libraries* that extend python's base functionality to add features. Your python code can leverage these libraries to reduce the amount of code you need to write to solve problems. These libraries are often given away for free. For example, PyTorch is a premier machine-learning library that anybody can use for free (https://pytorch.org/).

The python community encourages sharing code and best practices. There are thousands of resources to help you learn python.

== Notable Python Projects

Many thousands of projects have used python. Below are just a few that show the breadth of use cases for python.

* Python was used to analyze data to produce the first image of a black hole.

* Key parts of YouTube are written in python. Python is one of Google's official programming languages accepted for use within the company, and YouTube is owned by Google.
* Instagram uses python to serve its web pages.
* Dropbox wrote its initial server and desktop software in python.
* SQLMap is a tool to hack databases written in python.
* Disney's Toontown Online was a massively multiplayer online game written in python.

An investment in learning python can pay dividends because it can be used to solve a wide array of problems.

== Reflection

* What problems might you want to solve using python?
** Tasks you want to automate?
** Websites you want to build?
** Data you want to analyze?
