. Accept the license terms.
. Create a password for the administrator account. Tip: use `pa$$word1`. Because this VM is for testing, it's okay to use a common password. This password will meet the complexity requirements required by Windows.
. Windows will ask you to press control-alt-delte to log in. But if you enter that key combination, your host operating system will capture the keystrokes. To enter control-alt-delete in the VM, use the menus at the top of the virtual machine window to select `Input > Keyboard > Insert Ctrl-Alt-Del`.
