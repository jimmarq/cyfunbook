= Searching For Files

If you have ever forgotten where you saved a file, you know the value of search. Tools exist on Linux to search for files by file name, or you can search the contents of files.

== Learning Objectives

You should be able to:

* Search file name using `locate`
* Search file contents using `grep`

== Searching for File Names

The `locate` command can be used to find files by filename. The locate command searches all file names on the computer using an index that is rebuilt periodically (often daily). The index may not contain very new files. A benefit of the locate command is that it runs extremely quickly--the database is typically searched in a few seconds (depending on how many files are on the hard drive).

. Launch a Kali terminal.
. If your Kali virtual machine is new, the database of files might not be updated. Run the following command to update the database.
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo updatedb
----
. Imagine that you have heard that a Linux system serves web pages, and those web pages include a file called "index.html." But, you do not know what folder index.html is located in. Run the following command to find files and directories that have "index.html" in the name.
+
[source,shell]
----
locate index.html
----
+
You will see output similar to the following.
+
.'locate index.html' output
image::locate-index-html-output.png[locate index.html output]
. There are a lot of results. It may take some time to look through the results to find the file you really want.
. By default, `locate` finds matches in the directory or file name. So a search for "bunny" would find /home/kali/bunny/easter.txt and /home/kali/bunny.txt.
. To search only for file names (not directories), use the `-b` option.
+
[source,shell]
----
locate -b index.html
----

In this example, the file /var/www/html/index.html is the file you are looking for.

Remember that `locate` only looks at file names--it does not look at any of the file content.

== Load Files

. Run the following command in the Kali terminal to ensure you are in your home directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd ~
----
. Run the following command to delete the cyfunfiles directory (if it exists).
+
[source,shell]
----
rm -rf cyfunfiles
----
. Run the following command to download files from the internet. This will create a new folder called *cyfunfiles* in your home directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/jimmarq/cyfunfiles.git
----
. Change directories to the *cyfunfiles* directory.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd cyfunfiles
----
. Change directories to the *linux_finding* subdirectory.
+
[source,shell]
----
cd linux_finding
----
. Look at the files in the folder with `ls`.
+
[source,shell]
----
ls
----
+
.Contents of the cyfunfiles directory
image::linux_finding_files.png[contents of cyfunfiles]
. Use the `locate` command to look for fruits.txt.
+
[source,shell]
----
locate fruits.txt
----
+
If you just checked out the files from GitHub for the first time, the `locate` command could not find fruits.txt, even though you obviously see it.
. Run the following command to update the database of files on your system.
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo updatedb
----
+
You may need to enter the password `kali` if prompted. This command will take about 15 seconds to run. It is indexing all of the file names on your system.
. Run the following command to look for fruits.txt again.
+
[source,shell]
----
locate fruits.txt
----
+
You should see that fruits.txt can be found in /home/kali/cyfunfiles/linux_finding/.

== Using Find

The `find` command can be used to find files by name, size, or other attributes. The `find` command searches the file system each time it is run. This means that it can take a long time to run, depending on how many files are on the system. The `find` command is very flexible, and can be used to find files by name, size, or other attributes.

. Run the following command to find files with "fruits" in the name.
+
[source,shell]
----
find . -name "*fruits*"
----
+
In this case, the period tells `find` to start searching in the current directory. The `-name` option tells `find` to search for files with "fruits" in the name. The asterisks are wildcards that match any characters. So, the command will find files with "fruits" anywhere in the name.
. Run the following command to search the entire computer for files with the word "fruits" in the name.
+
[source,shell]
----
sudo find / -name "*fruits*"
----
+
The `sudo` command is required because `find` will search the entire computer, including directories that are not accessible to your user account. You may still get some access denied errors, but those wouldn't be places you'd be looking for files anyway.

== Challenge

. Find files with the name "firefox" in the file name only.
. Find files and directories with "apache" in the name.
. Dictionary and fuzzing attacks often use files called `wordlists`. Find files or directories with "wordlist" in the name.

== Reflection

* When would it be best to use **locate** to search for files?
* When would it be best to use **find** to search for files?
