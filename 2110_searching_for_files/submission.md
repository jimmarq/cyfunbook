# Searching For Files

## Screenshots

Include a screenshot of finding files on Linux using the **locate** command.

Include a screenshot of searching for text with **grep**.

## Reflection

How is searching with **locate** different than searching for files on Windows?

How is **grep** different than searching for contents on google.com?
